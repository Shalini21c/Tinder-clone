# Tinder-clone
Similar application like Tinder

This is a clone of Tinder which have the basics in it, more specifically it has the elementary or primary codes in it, of how any social networking application works, where any user can swipe between profiles anonymously. It includes a login window, register window, edit window, view profile part where the user can view other users, and lastly a logout part which logouts the current user and redirects the current user to the login page. The coding part was done using Python and PyCharm.

The code is divided into three parts:
* db helper part (for the database interface)
* gui helper part (for the user interface)
* tinder part (for handling the user interraction with other two interfaces)

**NOTE: I'm a newbie. This code can be modified as per the user requirement. And many extra function can also be added, which are not included in this code.
